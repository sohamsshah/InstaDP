## INTRODUCTION

<b>InstaDP</b> is a very useful Chrome Extension to download Instagram Display Pictures in just one click! Its User-friendly, Beautiful and Simple. 
The utility is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Chrome's Manifest. The Chrome Extension is activated <b>only</b> when user visits the Instagram Profile of someone. On all other pages,
this Chrome Extension is disabled. This feature makes more personalized and efficient.

## BACKGROUND

Instagram doesn't provide the feature to view/download the user's profile pictures and everyone on instagram zooms their browser to see it; still fails to do so. This was the motivation for developing this Project. Initially the idea was to develop a website for 
this utility, but after research for a better alternative; Chrome Extension seemed to be best fitting for such small but large-audience based application.  

---

## WHY CHROME EXTENSION IS BETTER ALTERNATIVE?

This utility is for a larger audience for varying age, nationality, literacy etc. Moreover, the Instagram users are always fleeting and scrolling the feed or texting, it is rare that
they open a new website by googling just to download the DP. Also, it doesn't seem user-friendly as majority aren't familiar with random websites. Thus, a simple Chrome Extension
can be handy and can SAVE developer's Server hosting cost of website to a larger scale. 

Moroever, this chrome extension is PAGE-specific and thus avoids the illegal Data-Scrappers to fetch Image Data of the Users from this utility; since this is developed for users.
Also, as this is a Chrome Extension, it is completely on Client Side. So no worries for Data-security aspects.
